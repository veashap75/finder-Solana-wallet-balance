## Key Features for Finding Solana Wallet Balances

1.  **Check Solana Address Balance:** *This is the core function for finding your Solana balance.* Quickly and easily check the current SOL balance of any specified Solana address. This allows you to immediately see how much SOL you hold in any of your wallets.

3.  **Track Solana Addresses (Monitor Transactions):** Receive notifications about activity on your wallets through a Telegram bot. Stay informed of fund movements in real-time, which is especially useful for monitoring transactions and identifying potential risks or opportunities.

4.  **Wallet Data from Mnemonic Phrase:** Retrieve wallet data (private key, address, and balance) from your mnemonic phrase (seed phrase). *This allows you to verify the balance of a wallet using your seed phrase*.

5.  **Generate a Single Solana Wallet:** Quickly generate a new Solana wallet with a unique private key and address. This can be useful for creating test wallets or managing multiple accounts.

6.  **Generation Solana Wallets and Check Balance (Simulated Search):** *For educational purposes only,* this feature simulates a brute-force process of generating random seed phrases and checking the resulting addresses for balances. *This demonstrates the importance of strong seed phrases*. If a wallet with a balance is found, the data is written to 'found-wallets.txt' and, if configured, a Telegram notification is sent.

## Setting Up Telegram Notifications

Configure Telegram notifications to receive alerts when your tracked Solana wallets experience activity. To enable this, input your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) in the 'telegram-settings.txt' file.

## Getting Started: Download or Build

You can download a pre-compiled build of SolanaChecker from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself. *Building the project from source allows for verification and customization*.

## Building the Project: Ensure Trust and Security

Building the project from the source code is highly recommended. This lets you verify that the code is doing what you expect it to do.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  Install **vcpkg** by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) if you donâ€™t have it installed.

2.  Add vcpkg to your system PATH.

3.  Install the required dependencies using the following commands:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Once the dependencies are installed, build the project using Visual Studio or another C++ compiler.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated with your development environment.
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Make sure all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg**.
2.  Compile the project using a command similar to this (adapt to your compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line: Finding and Monitoring Balances

Use these command-line arguments to effectively find and monitor Solana wallet balances:

1.  **-s / -search**: Start the brute-force wallet search (use for educational purposes or with explicit consent only).
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Track a specific address and receive Telegram notifications.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate a specified number of Solana wallets.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Get wallet information using a mnemonic phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: *Find and display the Solana balance of a given address.*
